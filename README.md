# Calender App

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is being distributed using Electron.

## App Installation

# For TAs

To install, simply clone the git, cd into the file and then run npm install ( This app requires Node to be on your PC! ) and then run npm run dev in a terminal.
You can also play around with editing the code (src contains all the functionality for the app). Just hit CTRL R and the app will reload whatever changes you've made.

You can also run npm run build to create a distributable file that you can share amongst yourselves. It will build a distributable for whatever OS the system uses.

We have a windows setup available for download at this link as well if cloning the whole repo isn't very appealing:
